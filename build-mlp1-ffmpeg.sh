# Cross-compile ffmpeg-rockchip as SHARED libraries for the MLP1 toolchain, so
# RetroArch can be built with --enable-ffmpeg and record through the RK3566 VPU.
#
# Why not the FFmpeg already on the device: LoongOS ships FFmpeg 4.4 built with
# --disable-encoders and only mjpeg/png re-enabled for video, no H.264 by any
# path, and only spdif/adts/asf/ipod/mpegts muxers. Linking RetroArch against it
# would give MJPEG-in-mpegts, software encoded, competing with the emulator for
# CPU. This build adds h264_rkmpp, which encodes on the VPU instead.
#
# SONAMEs do not collide with the stock libraries. ffmpeg-rockchip is FFmpeg 6.1
# (avcodec 60 / avformat 60 / avutil 58 / swscale 7 / swresample 4); the device
# carries the 4.4 set (58 / 58 / 56 / 5 / 3). Nothing on the device is shadowed,
# and RetroArch reaches ours through an RPATH rather than by luck.
#
# Runs INSIDE the mlp1-toolchain image. Adapted from moonlight-poc/build.sh,
# which proved the rkmpp path end to end (kmsgrab -> h264_rkmpp, 64-80 fps,
# near-idle CPU). Differences: shared instead of static, no Sunshine staging.
